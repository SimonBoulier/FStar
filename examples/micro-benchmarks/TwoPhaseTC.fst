(*
 * Uvar solutions are not always closed, they can have free universe names.
 * The substitution code relies on this assumption and does not substitute inside uvars.
 * This caused a breakage in the second phase (free universe names).
 * This breakage is currently masked by a normalization/compression pass between the two phases.
 * But we need a better solution.

(*
 * If the recursive let binding (xxx below) is added at different types to Gamma in the two phases,
 * the code below fails to typecheck. It infers the implicit in the call to g as int -> int -> Tot unit (phase 1),
 * whereas in the second phase, xxx has a type guarded by the precedes check.
 * We now add the let rec binding with precedes irrespective of lax mode

(*
 * This tests the type annotations on the dependent patterns.
 * Consider ExIntro IP hp in the function f21.
 * In the first phase, it is elaborated to: ExIntro (#uu1:Type0) (#uu2:@0 -> Type0) IP (hp:@0 IP)
 * Where @0, @1 etc. are de-bruijn variables.
 * When it is typechecked in the second phase, the annotation @0 IP for hp is typechecked
 * and the typechecker tries to prove that IP has type #uu1, which it fails to prove without any contextual information.
 * To prove it, we need the information that the scrutinee h is equal to the pattern ExIntro ... and then
 * type equalities kick in, I think.
